<h1 class="documentFirstHeading">RSS information</h1>
<p>	The <strong>RSS</strong> (abbreviation for <em><span>Really Simple Syndication</span></em>) is a news distribution
channel that facilitates access to the latest news of a Web site. It is a family of web feed formats used to publish
frequently updated digital content, such as blogs, news feeds or podcasts.</p>
<p>Users of RSS content use programs called	feed "readers" or "aggregators": the user subscribes to a feed by supplying to his or her reader a link to the feed; the reader	can then check the user's subscribed feeds to see if any of those feeds have new content since the last time it was checked, and if so, retrieve that content and present it to the user. This site incorporates this service in all the pages where this RSS icon <i class="bi bi-rss-fill"></i> appears.</p>
